The notes I took when studying the course MIT 18.065 Matrix Methods In Data Analysis, Signal Processing, And Machine Learning.

To help you have a visualization understanding of linear algebra, I recommend you to watch the videos from the lengendary [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) and one of his successors [Visual Kernel](https://www.youtube.com/@visualkernel4178).
