    "As I said before, Eigenvectors are thoes vectors that do not change direction when a linear transformation $A$ is applied to them. Formally, the eigenvector $x$ of $A$ is a vector such that $Ax = \\lambda x$ for some scalar $\\lambda$. If we allied the $A$ to $Av$ again, what will happen? The $x$ will be scaled again, but the direction maintains. Thus, $A^2x=\\lambda^2x$."
